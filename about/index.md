#About Us

Our focus is to improve the current state of food chain focused around the food and related commodities market through our SaaS platform.

In the current model, in a world-wide finding by [Food and Agriculture Organization](http://www.fao.org/) (a UN Organization), [about a third of the food never reaches our plates](http://www.fao.org/save-food/en/), world-wide.

The wastage of food contributes to increased CO2 emission from the food wastage itself and also transportation. Other impact includes, increase in food prices (resulting in reduction of spending in other markets), impact on low-income families and securities, and others.

With the exponential increase in world-wide population, as well as food and energy demands, we are  motivated to design and develop software, hardware and policy solutions that can help food producers, distributors, processors and retailers in the food supply chain targeted to the local markets.
